# Football Player Recommendation Systems

## Project Motivation
Every football season, many players stand out in their teams and end up being bought by other teams during the transfer window. This causes several clubs to lose important pieces, making them have to go to the market to look for a replacement. Sometimes, there is no time for a deeper analysis of the players by the clubs, causing many wrong signings to be made.

Therefore, to help clubs and their scouts, this recommendation system was created, taking into account the numbers of each player in his last full season.
